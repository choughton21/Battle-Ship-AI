# Battle-Ship-AI


INTRODUCTION

In this project, I teach a computer to play battleship. Since battleship is a technical game
and the ideal moves change sa the game progresses, it is interesting to see how well we are 
able to tach the AI to play. The main reason this is a challenging task is that we need advanced
algorithms to learn how to play the game, if we want our AI to actually play well, and the learning
technique needs to understand how to learn well. If an adult plays battelship against a toddler
who makes moves randomly, the adult will win almost every time. Our goal is to train the computer
to play less like a toddler making random moves and more like a skilled adult; this is a
challenging task. The fact that deep learning is a black box is a further difficulty since we 
cannot help the computer learn better since we do not know how it is learning exactly, and we only
see performance. We hope to find that after training, our AI is able to play battleship well beyond
that of a random player.

In terms of an ethical extension, as battlehsip is a game that mimicks a military procedure, we talk
about some of the ethical implications of AI being used for military purposes.
